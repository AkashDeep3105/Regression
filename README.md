# Regression
Implementing different Regression modls

Overview

This repository contains implementations of various regression models used in machine learning and statistical analysis. Regression models help in predicting continuous target variables based on input features.

Types of Regression Models Implemented

1. Linear Regression

Assumes a linear relationship between independent and dependent variables.

Uses the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method to minimize the error.

2. Polynomial Regression

Extends linear regression by introducing polynomial terms.

Useful when the relationship between variables is non-linear.

3. Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Uses Support Vector Machines for regression problems.

Works well for small and complex datasets.

4. Decision Tree Regression

A tree-based model that splits data into regions.

Prone to overfitting but performs well on structured data.

5. Random Forest Regression

An ensemble of multiple decision trees.

Provides better generalization compared to a single decision tree.
